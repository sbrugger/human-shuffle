# Human Shuffle

This project was inspired by the ever-present coding interview question, "How would you simulate shuffling a deck of cards?" What the interviewer really means by that question is, "How would you randomize the order of elements in an array?" Unfortunately, that question is (in my opinion) much less interesting than the original. I'd much rather think about how I can use an algorithm to simulate the results of what a person would actually do in the shuffling process!

# Types of Shuffling Implimented
<b>Riffle Shuffle:</b><br>
This type of shuffling is what many people first picture when they think of shuffling. The deck is split in half, one half placed in each of the shuffler's hands. The shuffler allows a few cards from the bottom of one hand to fall to a new pile, then allows a few from the bottom of the other hand to fall to the same pile, alternating back and forth until the entire deck sits in the new pile.

Since this project is intended for my own 'for fun' purposes, I will admit that my reference is mostly [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling). I'll add more reference links here as I use them.
